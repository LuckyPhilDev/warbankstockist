### 🛑 Known Issues & Future Ideas

- **Stack merging limitations:** When depositing & Withdrawing, the addon currently does not always merge items into partially filled stacks in the Warband Bank. This may leave excess items in your inventory if multiple partial stacks exist. - Re-opening the warband bank will help with this.

With **Warbank Stockist**, you’ll always be prepared — whether you’re switching specs, gearing alts, or just keeping your bags tidy.

> *Note: Requires access to the Warband Bank and works best with consistent item availability.*
